# Production Hardening

This app was originally deployable but not production-grade for unattended, single-user homelab
operation — a redeploy could wipe production data, password reset was silently broken, timestamps
on the `users` connection were off by ~8 hours, and there was no TLS, no backups, and no runtime
services beyond the web request/response cycle. This document records what changed, why, and what's
still a deliberate follow-up rather than something silently left undone.

## What changed

### Deploy pipeline no longer destroys data

`infrastructure/ansible/playbooks/app-server.yml` used to run `php artisan db:fresh-all --seed` on
**every** deploy — that command drops every table on all 5 databases and reseeds from scratch. Any
redeploy after go-live would have wiped real data. It's now: `optimize:clear` → `migrate --force`
(always, idempotent) → `db:seed --force` gated on a `storage/.provisioned` flag file that only gets
created once → `config:cache`/`route:cache`/`view:cache`/`event:cache` → `storage:link`.
`db:fresh-all` is no longer called anywhere in the playbook. The `git` clone task also now uses
`update: true` so a redeploy actually pulls new commits, and `key:generate` only runs on a genuinely
fresh `.env` (regenerating `APP_KEY` on every deploy would invalidate every existing session).

The two migrations that had only ever run against the `_test` databases —
`0001_01_01_000001_create_password_reset_tokens_table` and
`2026_01_13_000002_add_remember_token_to_users_table` — were applied to the real production
`workshop_2` databases as a one-time catch-up. Password reset was silently broken in production
until this ran.

### Timezone alignment

`config/app.php`'s timezone is `Asia/Kuala_Lumpur`, but none of the 5 DB connections set a session
timezone, so every PHP-side timestamp write disagreed with the database by ~8 hours (`audit_logs`,
Eloquent `updated_at`, `User::isLocked()`'s comparison against `locked_until`). `config/database.php`
now sets `'timezone'` on all 5 connections — `'Asia/Kuala_Lumpur'` for `users` (PostgreSQL, which has
its own tzdata), `'+08:00'` for the 4 MySQL/MariaDB connections (the named zone isn't loaded on those
servers; Malaysia has no DST, so a fixed offset is exact and never drifts). This also fixed a
documented time-of-day-dependent flake in `tests/Procedures/BookingTriggersTest.php`.

### Session/cache/queue decoupled from the `users` database

Production's `.env` had `CACHE_STORE=database` and `SESSION_DRIVER=database`, both of which resolve
to the `users` (PostgreSQL) connection — meaning a single Postgres outage would have taken down every
page's session along with it, undermining the graceful-degradation behavior the app otherwise tests
for. Both are now `file`, matching what the app's own DB circuit breaker already assumes internally.
`QUEUE_CONNECTION` is now `sync` — there are no `Jobs`/`Mail`/`Notifications` classes and no
`ShouldQueue` usage anywhere in `app/`, so a database-backed queue needing its own worker process was
unused complexity.

### Scheduler runs via systemd

`routes/console.php` schedules `db:refresh-status` (every minute) and `taufiq:refresh-stats` (every 5
minutes), but nothing ever invoked `php artisan schedule:run` on a recurring basis in production —
both had been silently dead in every deployment so far. A systemd timer
(`infrastructure/ansible/templates/laravel-scheduler.timer.j2`, fires every minute) now drives a
oneshot service that runs `schedule:run`. No queue worker was added — see above.

### TLS via nginx + Let's Encrypt

nginx used to listen on `:80` only. The playbook now requires `app_domain` and `certbot_email`
variables (fails early with a clear message if either is missing — a public DNS record for
`app_domain` and inbound `:443` must already be in place), obtains a certificate via certbot's
webroot challenge, and serves `:443` with HSTS, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`,
`Referrer-Policy`, and `X-XSS-Protection`. `:80` redirects to `:443` once a certificate exists.
`APP_URL` is now `https://{{ app_domain }}`, `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE`/`SESSION_ENCRYPT` are both
`true`, and `AppServiceProvider::boot()` calls `URL::forceScheme('https')` in production (nginx
terminates TLS and proxies plain HTTP to php-fpm, so Laravel never sees `https://` directly).

**Deliberately not added yet: a Content-Security-Policy.** The app loads several external CDNs
(Tailwind, Font Awesome, Leaflet, Nominatim for reverse geocoding) — a CSP needs its own scoped pass
to enumerate every legitimate external origin without breaking the map/geocoding flow. Flagged here
as a follow-up, not silently skipped.

### Mail

Production had no `MAIL_*` configuration at all, so it silently used Laravel's own `log` mailer
default — password reset emails were written to `storage/logs` instead of being sent.
`infrastructure/ansible/templates/env-app.j2` now has a full SMTP block (`MAIL_MAILER`, `MAIL_HOST`,
`MAIL_PORT`, `MAIL_USERNAME`, `MAIL_PASSWORD`, `MAIL_SCHEME`, `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`, `MAIL_FROM_NAME`),
templated the same way as the existing Cloudinary/ToyyibPay blocks. **This is the one setting that
needs a real external secret** — supply working SMTP credentials (a Gmail app password, SendGrid,
Mailgun, or a homelab relay) via `-e` or a vaulted vars file before deploying, or password reset will
continue to silently do nothing.

### Automated backups

None of the 3 database engines had any backup task anywhere in `infrastructure/`. Each now runs a
nightly (02:00, systemd timer) dump via a small script:

- **PostgreSQL** (`templates/backup-postgres.sh.j2`): `pg_dump -U postgres workshop_2 | gzip`
- **MySQL / MariaDB** (`templates/backup-mysql.sh.j2`, shared by both engines):
  `mysqldump --single-transaction --routines --triggers workshop_2 | gzip` — `--routines` matters
  specifically here: unlike triggers, `mysqldump` does not include stored procedures by default, and
  this app's CRUD paths lean on them heavily.

Both write to `/var/backups/workshop_2/workshop_2_<timestamp>.sql.gz` and prune anything older than 7
days (`find ... -mtime +7 -delete`).

**Not implemented: an off-VM copy.** All 3 homelab DB VMs share one Proxmox node — losing that node
loses every local backup too. Rsync/scp'ing each night's dump to another host (e.g. app-server) would
close that gap, but it requires setting up new passwordless SSH trust from 3 separate production VMs
pushing to another live host, which is a more invasive change (touching `authorized_keys` on multiple
production machines) than "add a backup job." Recommended as a deliberate follow-up, not bundled in
silently.

**Restore runbook** (not yet drilled on real hardware — see Verification below):

1. Stop the app (or put it in maintenance mode) so nothing writes mid-restore.
2. For PostgreSQL: `gunzip -c workshop_2_<ts>.sql.gz | psql -U postgres workshop_2`
3. For MySQL/MariaDB: `gunzip -c workshop_2_<ts>.sql.gz | mysql workshop_2`
4. Restore order matters because cross-database references are logical, not enforced by a real
   foreign key: restore `animals` and `shelter` before `booking`/`reporting`, since `booking.adoption`
   and `booking.animal_booking` reference `animals.animal` by ID with no DB-level constraint — if
   `booking` is restored to a point where it references animal IDs that don't exist yet, the app will
   surface those as orphaned-reference errors (the same class of issue the Phase 8 guard below now
   catches going forward) rather than a hard failure, so this is a correctness concern, not a
   catastrophic one.
5. Restart the app and spot-check `/api/database-status` and a few real pages before resuming traffic.

### Animal delete now blocks on real adoption/booking references

`ManagesAnimals::destroy()` called the delete procedure with no check for referencing rows on the
`booking` connection (`adoption`, `animal_booking`) — a different physical server, so no real foreign
key could enforce this. Deleting an adopted or booked animal silently orphaned those rows (this was
already proven by `tests/Feature/CrossDb/OrphanRiskTest.php`, which asserted the orphan happening).
The controller now checks for any referencing row first and blocks the delete with a clear error if
one exists — matching the guard pattern already used in `ManagesReports::destroy()`. It fails closed
if the `booking` connection itself is unreachable, rather than proceeding without being able to
verify. `OrphanRiskTest.php` was inverted to assert the block; verified red-then-green.

### Logging

`LOG_STACK` was never set in production, so `LOG_CHANNEL=stack` silently fell back to `'single'` — an
unbounded `storage/logs/laravel.log`. It's now `LOG_STACK=daily`, using `config/logging.php`'s own
14-day default retention. nginx's own access/error logs don't need a new logrotate entry — Ubuntu's
`nginx` package already ships one via `nginx-common`.

**Existing health surfaces, now worth pointing a monitor at**: Laravel's built-in `/up`
(`bootstrap/app.php`) and this app's own `/api/database-status` (`routes/web.php`), which reports
per-connection reachability. External error tracking (Sentry/Flare) is intentionally out of scope for
a single-user homelab — the daily log is the sink.

### Removed: non-functional email-verification scaffolding

Routes, controllers, and a view for Laravel's standard email-verification flow existed but were never
wired up — `User` didn't implement `MustVerifyEmail`, no migration ever added an `email_verified_at`
column, and registration never fired the event that would trigger a verification email. By explicit
decision (a single-user deployment gets no real value from this), the scaffolding was removed rather
than completed: the 3 controllers, the verification routes, the dead `<form>` in the profile page, and
the now-meaningless `email_verified_at` cast on `User`.

## Known follow-ups (flagged, not silently skipped)

- **Content-Security-Policy** — needs its own pass to enumerate the CDN origins this app actually
  loads without breaking the map/geocoding flow.
- **Off-VM backup copies** — see the Backups section above.
- **A real restore drill** — the runbook above hasn't been exercised against real hardware.
- **`TOYYIBPAY_BASE_URL` still points at the ToyyibPay sandbox** (`dev.toyyibpay.com`). Switching to
  the live payment gateway is a financial decision with real consequences — left for whoever owns
  that decision to make explicitly, not bundled into infra hardening.
- **Ansible syntax was never run through `ansible-playbook --syntax-check`** — this hardening pass was
  done from a Windows dev machine with no `ansible`/Python installed. Every YAML file was reviewed by
  hand for indentation and brace-balance correctness, but an automated syntax check on the actual
  control node is worth doing before the next real deploy.
- **A live end-to-end HTTPS check** (`https://{{ app_domain }}` actually serving, password reset email
  actually arriving) needs a real public domain and SMTP credentials, neither of which exist on this
  dev machine.

## Verification

Everything above was verified as directly as this environment allowed:

- The full Pest suite (`php artisan test --env=testing`) was re-run after every code-level change
  (timezone config, the animal-delete guard, the email-verification removal) — **364 tests passed, 0
  failed** each time, against the real distributed test databases, not mocks.
- The two production migrations were applied and confirmed live via
  `Schema::connection('users')->hasTable('password_reset_tokens')` and `hasColumn('users',
  'remember_token')`.
- The timezone fix was confirmed with a live probe comparing PHP's `now()` against each connection's
  own session clock — the skew dropped from ~8 hours to sub-second.
- The animal-delete guard was verified red-then-green: the updated tests fail without the fix (`git
  stash` on just the controller change) and pass with it.
- The `mysqldump` backup command was run directly against the real local MySQL instance (a safe,
  read-only operation) and produced a valid dump containing real tables, procedures, and triggers.
  `pg_dump` was reviewed by hand — no PostgreSQL client tools are installed on this dev machine.
- What could **not** be verified from this environment: a live systemd timer actually firing, a real
  TLS handshake against a public domain, an actual SMTP delivery, and a real backup restore drill —
  all of these need the real homelab hardware and, in two cases, external secrets/domains this
  session didn't have.
