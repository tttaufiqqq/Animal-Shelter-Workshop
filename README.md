---

## 📖 Overview

The **Animal Rescue & Adoption Management System** is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline animal rescue operations, medical records management, shelter inventory tracking, and adoption processes. This project showcases a **distributed database architecture** with 5 separate databases across different database engines (PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server), demonstrating advanced database integration and cross-database relationship management.

The system provides role-based access control for administrators, caretakers, and general users, ensuring efficient animal welfare tracking, rescue coordination, and adoption services. Built as an academic project for BITU3923 Workshop II at Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM), it demonstrates enterprise-level software architecture and distributed systems design.

# 🗄️ Distributed Database Architecture

## Overview

This project implements a **distributed database architecture** with 5 separate databases, each hosted on different database engines and ports. This architecture demonstrates real-world scenarios where organizations integrate multiple legacy systems or distribute data across different database technologies for scalability, performance, or organizational reasons.

**Key Challenge**: Cross-database relationships cannot use traditional foreign key constraints. All referential integrity is enforced at the **application layer** using Laravel's Eloquent ORM.

## Database Connections

| Connection Name | Database Engine | Port | Module/Domain | Key Tables |
|----------------|-----------------|------|---------------|------------|
| **taufiq** | PostgreSQL | 5434 | User Management | users, roles, permissions, adopter_profiles |
| **eilya** | MySQL | 3307 | Stray Reporting Management | reports, rescues, images |
| **shafiqah** | MySQL | 3309 | Animal Management | animals, medical_records, vaccinations, clinics, vets, animal_profiles |
| **atiqah** | MySQL | 3308 | Shelter Management | slots, sections, inventory, categories |
| **danish** | SQL Server | 1434 | Booking & Adoption Management | bookings, adoptions, transactions, visit_lists, animal_booking (pivot) |

## Cross-Database Relationship Pattern

Since foreign key constraints cannot exist across databases, the project uses a special Eloquent pattern:

```php
// Example: Animal model (shafiqah) accessing Rescue (eilya)
public function rescue()
{
    return $this->setConnection('reporting')
        ->belongsTo(Rescue::class, 'rescueID', 'id');
}

// Example: Booking (danish) accessing Animal (shafiqah)
public function animals()
{
    return $this->belongsToMany(
        Animal::class,
        'animal_booking',
        'bookingID',
        'animalID'
    )->using(AnimalBooking::class);
}
```

## Developer Guidelines

### 1. Always Specify Database Connection

Each Eloquent model explicitly declares its connection:

```php
class Animal extends Model
{
    protected $connection = 'animals';
}
```

### 2. Validate Foreign Keys at Application Layer

Before creating records with cross-database foreign keys, always validate:

```php
// Check if rescue exists before creating animal
$rescue = Rescue::find($rescueId);
if (!$rescue) {
    throw new Exception('Invalid rescue ID');
}
```

### 3. Use Transactions Per Database

When modifying multiple databases, use separate transactions:

```php
DB::connection('animals')->beginTransaction();
DB::connection('reporting')->beginTransaction();

try {
    Animal::create([...]); // shafiqah
    Image::create([...]);  // eilya

    DB::connection('animals')->commit();
    DB::connection('reporting')->commit();
} catch (\Exception $e) {
    DB::connection('animals')->rollBack();
    DB::connection('reporting')->rollBack();
}
```

### 4. Test Cross-Database Queries

Always test queries that span multiple databases with proper error handling.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js & npm
- PostgreSQL 14+
- MySQL 8.0+
- SQL Server 2019+
- Git

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Animal-Shelter-Workshop
   ```

2. **Install dependencies and setup environment**
   ```bash
   composer setup
   # This runs: composer install, copies .env, generates app key, and builds assets
   ```

3. **Configure database connections**

   Edit `.env` file and configure all 5 database connections:
   ```env
   # Eilya (MySQL) - Stray Reporting
   DB1_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB1_PORT=3307
   DB1_DATABASE=workshop
   DB1_USERNAME=root
   DB1_PASSWORD=your_password

   # Atiqah (MySQL) - Shelter Management
   DB2_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB2_PORT=3308
   DB2_DATABASE=workshop2
   DB2_USERNAME=root
   DB2_PASSWORD=your_password

   # Shafiqah (MySQL) - Animal Management
   DB3_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB3_PORT=3309
   DB3_DATABASE=workshop
   DB3_USERNAME=root
   DB3_PASSWORD=your_password

   # Danish (SQL Server) - Booking & Adoption
   DB4_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB4_PORT=1434
   DB4_DATABASE=workshop
   DB4_USERNAME=sa
   DB4_PASSWORD=your_password

   # Taufiq (PostgreSQL) - User Management
   DB5_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB5_PORT=5434
   DB5_DATABASE=workshop
   DB5_USERNAME=postgres
   DB5_PASSWORD=your_password

   # Session driver (use file for distributed databases)
   SESSION_DRIVER=file
   ```

4. **Run migrations and seeders**
   ```bash
   # Use custom command for distributed databases
   php artisan db:fresh-all --seed
   # OR using composer shortcut
   composer fresh
   ```

5. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   composer dev
   # This runs: php artisan serve, queue worker, log viewer, and Vite concurrently
   ```

6. **Access the application**

   Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

### Default Login Credentials

After seeding, you can login with:

- **Admin**: admin@example.com
- **Caretaker**: caretaker@example.com
- **User**: user@example.com

(Check `database/seeders/UserSeeder.php` for passwords)

---

## 🧪 Development Commands

### Database Operations

```bash
# Fresh migration for ALL 5 databases
php artisan db:fresh-all

# Fresh migration with seeding
php artisan db:fresh-all --seed
composer fresh  # shortcut

# Clear database connection status cache
php artisan db:clear-status-cache

# Standard migration (only for new migrations)
php artisan migrate

# Seed only
php artisan db:seed
```

**IMPORTANT**: Always use `db:fresh-all` instead of `migrate:fresh` for this project. Laravel's default `migrate:fresh` only drops tables from the default connection, not all 5 distributed databases.

### Running Development Environment

```bash
# Run all services concurrently (recommended)
composer dev

# Or run individually:
php artisan serve              # Development server
php artisan queue:listen --tries=1  # Queue worker
php artisan pail --timeout=0   # Log viewer
npm run dev                    # Vite asset compilation
```

### Testing

```bash
composer test           # Run all Pest tests
php artisan test        # Laravel test runner
php artisan test --filter=TestName  # Specific test
```

### Code Quality

```bash
./vendor/bin/pint       # Format code with Laravel Pint
```

### Assets

```bash
npm run dev            # Development mode with HMR
npm run build          # Production build
```
